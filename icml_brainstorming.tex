\begin{abstract}
%=============================================================================
We present a physics-constrained dilated convolutional network that maps 31 coupled drift-diffusion parameters to full current-voltage (J-V) curve representations for perovskite solar cells.
On ${\sim}15$k held-out devices spanning $>$20 orders of magnitude in parameter space, the model achieves median $R^2 = 0.9975$, median MAE\,$=$\,$2.96$~A/m$^2$, and median $V_{oc}$ error of 0.39~mV---an order of magnitude below experimental measurement uncertainty.
Three physics priors act complementarily:
(i)~71 analytically derived drift-diffusion features as input enrichment, of which train-only selection retains only $m{=}5$, revealing that J-V shape is governed by a low-dimensional manifold spanning five independent physical mechanisms: photocurrent generation ($J_{max}$), band gap energetics ($E_g$), built-in field alignment ($E_g^{offset}$), interface band alignment ($\chi_P^e$), and recombination losses ($V_{oc}^{loss}$);
(ii)~soft monotonicity, convexity, and curvature penalties encoding first-principles shape constraints;
(iii)~Jacobian smoothness regularization for well-posedness.
Upstream scalar predictions ($V_{oc}$, $V_{mpp}$) from independently trained ANNs~\cite{zhao2025ae} condition the curve model in a modular two-stage surrogate pipeline.
Systematic ablation across 30 runs (10 configurations $\times$ 3 seeds) demonstrates that bidirectional dilated convolution \emph{without} self-attention is optimal for this task---dilation alone spans the 8-point receptive field, making attention redundant and consistently harmful.
Training completes in ${\sim}10$~min on a single GPU; inference achieves $>$$10^4\times$ speedup over COMSOL finite-element simulation, enabling million-device screening in under one hour.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%=============================================================================

Perovskite solar cells have emerged as a transformative photovoltaic technology, exceeding 26\% power conversion efficiency (PCE) in single-junction and 28\% in tandem configurations~\cite{zhao2023phd}.
Their ABX$_3$ crystal structure offers continuously tunable band gaps spanning 1.2--2.3~eV~\cite{zhao2025ae}, making them ideal candidates for multi-junction architectures.
However, optimizing these devices requires navigating a high-dimensional parameter space $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{31}$ encompassing bandgaps, carrier mobilities, layer thicknesses, doping densities, recombination coefficients, and contact work functions---parameters that interact through coupled nonlinear drift-diffusion physics.

The standard computational approach is coupled Poisson--drift-diffusion simulation via COMSOL finite-element methods (FEM), which faithfully resolves the transport physics but costs ${\sim}4800$~s per device.
At this cost, a comprehensive $10^6$-device screening campaign would require ${\sim}160$ years of compute time, making exhaustive design-space exploration infeasible.

Zhao et al.~\cite{zhao2025ae} achieved $>$$10^3\times$ speedup for \emph{scalar} device metrics ($V_{oc}$, FF, PCE) using three-layer ANNs with Bayesian regularization, trained on 100k Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) COMSOL simulations.
However, scalar metrics are \emph{emergent} from J-V curve shape and fundamentally miss critical device signatures:
S-shaped kinks indicating interface barriers,
the drift-to-recombination transition at the maximum power point (MPP),
voltage-dependent current partitioning between extraction and recombination,
and fill-factor degradation modes that manifest only in the curve's curvature profile.
Two devices with identical PCE can have qualitatively different J-V shapes---and correspondingly different stability, degradation, and operating-point characteristics.

We address this gap by predicting full J-V curves from material parameters, contributing:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Physics-informed input enrichment} (\S\ref{sec:physics_features}): 71 analytical drift-diffusion features ($L_n$, $\Theta_e$, $R_s$, composites) that shortcut representation learning.
    Train-only feature selection reveals that only $m{=}5$ carry non-redundant predictive information, each mapping to an independent physical mechanism: photocurrent ceiling ($J_{max}$), band gap ($E_g$), energetic alignment ($E_g^{offset}$), interface band alignment ($\chi_P^e$), and recombination loss ($V_{oc}^{loss}$) (\S\ref{sec:feature_selection}).

    \item \textbf{Physics-constrained loss} (\S\ref{sec:loss}): soft penalties encoding $dJ/dV \leq 0$ (monotonicity), $d^2J/dV^2 \leq 0$ (convexity near the knee), bounded curvature, and Jacobian smoothness---the same qualitative properties guaranteed by the drift-diffusion equations.

    \item \textbf{Modular two-stage pipeline} (\S\ref{sec:scalar_pipeline}): upstream ANNs~\cite{zhao2025ae} provide $V_{oc}$, $V_{mpp}$ as conditioning inputs with no inter-stage gradient flow, enabling independent validation and swappable scalar sources.

    \item \textbf{Architecture selection via systematic ablation} (\S\ref{sec:ablation}): 10 configurations $\times$ 3 seeds testing dilation, directionality, attention, scalar conditioning, data scaling, training length, and batch size.
\end{enumerate}

Before describing the methodology, we present the key results to establish the reconstruction quality achieved by this approach.

%=============================================================================
\section{Results: Curve Reconstruction Quality}
\label{sec:results}
%=============================================================================

We front-load results to provide immediate context for the methodological choices that follow.
All metrics are evaluated on ${\sim}15$k held-out test devices (10\% of ${\sim}150$k total) that the model has never seen during training or hyperparameter selection.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Reconstruction Gallery}
\label{sec:gallery}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Figure~\ref{fig:random_samples} displays J-V reconstructions for randomly sampled test devices spanning the full performance range.
The model's 8-point PCHIP representation, interpolated back to a dense voltage grid via Fritsch--Carlson monotone cubic Hermite interpolation~\cite{fritsch1980monotone}, faithfully captures both the flat photocurrent plateau at low voltages and the sharp sigmoidal transition at the knee/MPP region.
The vast majority of devices achieve $R^2 > 0.99$; the rare low-$R^2$ cases correspond to pathological device configurations discussed in \S\ref{sec:failure_analysis}.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{test_plots_random_samples.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Random test-set reconstructions} ($R^2 = 0.58$--$0.999$). Blue circles: 8 PCHIP query points predicted by the dilated conv model; dashed: PCHIP reconstruction; solid grey: COMSOL finite-element reference. The model captures flat-band plateaus, sharp knees, and the approach to $V_{oc}$ across devices with widely varying material parameters. The rare low-$R^2$ cases (bottom row) correspond to S-shaped or barrier-dominated devices where physics constraints \emph{correctly refuse} unphysical fits (\S\ref{sec:failure_analysis}).}
    \label{fig:random_samples}
\end{figure}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Primary Performance}
\label{sec:primary_performance}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Table~\ref{tab:primary_results} reports performance of the primary model (bidirectional dilated conv, batch size 512, with physics features) on the held-out test set, averaged over 3 random seeds.

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Test-set performance (${\sim}15$k devices), averaged over 3 seeds ($\pm$ seed-to-seed std). The mean--median gap in $R^2$ reflects a long left tail from pathological devices (\S\ref{sec:failure_analysis}), not systematic bias.}
\label{tab:primary_results}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lrr@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Mean} & \textbf{Median} \\
\midrule
$R^2$ (per-curve, $\Delta V$-weighted) & $0.9858 \pm 0.0009$ & $\mathbf{0.9975 \pm 0.0004}$ \\
MAE (A/m$^2$) & $4.75 \pm 0.26$ & $2.96 \pm 0.34$ \\
RMSE (A/m$^2$) & $6.66 \pm 0.26$ & $4.27 \pm 0.34$ \\
$|V_{oc}$ error$|$ (V) & $0.0056 \pm 0.0058$ & $\mathbf{0.00039 \pm 0.00016}$ \\
$|I_{sc}$ error$|$ (A/m$^2$) & $0.59 \pm 0.53$ & $0.36 \pm 0.62$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Physical significance.}
The median MAE of 2.96~A/m$^2$ corresponds to $<$0.5\% of a typical $J_{sc} \approx 200$~A/m$^2$, meaning the model faithfully resolves both the flat-band photocurrent magnitude and the sharp transition at MPP where most power extraction occurs.
The $I_{sc}$ median error of 0.36~A/m$^2$ (with seed-to-seed variability of $\pm$0.62) confirms that the flat-band region ($V \ll V_{mpp}$) is trivially learned---consistent with the physics, since $J(V \!\approx\! 0) \approx J_{sc}$ is determined primarily by photogeneration and collection efficiency, which are well-captured by the input features.

The median $V_{oc}$ error of 0.39~mV is an order of magnitude below typical experimental measurement uncertainty ($\pm$5~mV for perovskite devices with hysteresis), meaning the model's voltage-axis localization of the open-circuit point is more precise than what current fabrication and measurement technology can resolve.
This sub-millivolt precision in $V_{oc}$ reconstruction is important because $V_{oc}$ determines the upper voltage bound of the J-V curve, and errors in $V_{oc}$ propagate into the reconstructed current values throughout the knee region where $dJ/dV$ is large.

\paragraph{The mean--median gap.}
The gap between mean $R^2 = 0.986$ and median $R^2 = 0.998$ indicates that fewer than 1\% of devices account for the majority of aggregate error.
This asymmetry is by design: the physics constraints \emph{correctly refuse} to fit S-shaped or concave-up curves that violate the monotone-sigmoid assumption (\S\ref{sec:failure_analysis}).
A model that achieved higher mean $R^2$ by fitting these pathological devices would necessarily sacrifice physical plausibility on the remaining 99\%.

\paragraph{Computational performance.}
Total wall time: ${\sim}10$~min (preprocessing 24~s, training ${\sim}9.5$~min, inference ${\sim}10$~s on ${\sim}15$k test samples).
Training throughput: ${\sim}12.7$k samples/s (batch size 512); inference throughput: ${\sim}1.4$k samples/s.
This represents $>$$10^4\times$ speedup over COMSOL FEM per device, enabling a $10^6$-device Latin Hypercube screening sweep in $<$1~hour.

\subsection{Architecture Ablation}
\label{sec:ablation}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We conducted a systematic ablation spanning 10 configurations $\times$ 3 seeds = 30 runs, isolating the contributions of dilation, directionality (causal vs.\ bidirectional), self-attention, spatial mixing, scalar conditioning, dataset size, training duration, and batch size.
Table~\ref{tab:ablation_results} summarizes the results; all values are averaged over 3 seeds with $\pm$ indicating seed-to-seed standard deviation.

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Architecture ablation (30 runs = 10 configurations $\times$ 3 seeds). All bidirectional conv variants (rows~1--3) achieve $R^2_{med} \geq 0.996$; attention (rows~6--7) and pointwise architectures (row~5) are consistently worse. The champion configuration (row~1, batch~512) achieves the highest median $R^2$ and lowest median MAE.}
\label{tab:ablation_results}
\begin{tabular}{@{}rlcccc@{}}

5 & Pointwise ($1{\times}1$) & $.9890{\pm}.0004$ & $6.48{\pm}.04$ & $6.11{\pm}1.35$ & $1.31{\pm}1.18$ \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Spatial mixing is essential.}
The pointwise ($1{\times}1$ convolution) baseline (row~5) achieves only $R^2_{med} = 0.989$, confirming that inter-voltage-point information exchange is critical for J-V reconstruction.
Without spatial mixing, each voltage point is predicted independently from the device embedding, preventing the network from leveraging the smooth, monotone structure of J-V curves.

\paragraph{Self-attention as negative control.}
Adding 4-head self-attention ($d_{model} = 64$) consistently degrades all metrics (rows~6--7 vs.\ rows~2, 4; Figure~\ref{fig:attention_impact}).
The degradation is both large (median $R^2$ drops from ${\sim}0.997$ to ${\sim}0.991$) and structurally explained: on 8-point sequences the dilated conv receptive field already exceeds the sequence length (Block~3 with $d{=}2$, $k{=}5$ gives RF $> 8$), so attention's $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ pairwise interactions are redundant.
J-V spatial correlations decay monotonically with voltage separation, matching convolution's local inductive bias; attention treats all pairs uniformly, amplifying noise from weakly coupled voltage points.
The Conv+Attn configuration's extreme $V_{oc}$ instability ($23.7 \pm 39.9$~mV, driven by a single catastrophic seed) further demonstrates that attention introduces harmful optimization landscape pathologies.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{dilation_n_attention.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Self-attention consistently degrades performance.}
    Paired comparisons across Conv$\pm$Attn and TCN$\pm$Attn backbones. Adding attention worsens median $R^2$, MAE, $V_{oc}$ error, and $I_{sc}$ error in every case, confirming that the conv's full receptive field makes attention redundant and harmful on short physics-governed sequences.}
    \label{fig:attention_impact}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Bidirectional vs.\ causal.}
Bidirectional convolution and causal TCN achieve similar median $R^2$ ($0.9964$ vs.\ $0.9965$), but the TCN shows substantially higher $V_{oc}$ error variance ($1.51 \pm 1.68$~mV vs.\ $1.04 \pm 0.30$~mV for Conv-Dilated, and $0.39 \pm 0.16$~mV for BS512).
This instability reflects the physics: J-V curves are thermodynamic equilibrium responses---at any voltage, the current depends on the full band diagram, not just lower-voltage behavior---so causal masking discards physically relevant context, particularly near $V_{oc}$ where high-voltage information is essential.

\paragraph{Batch size and data scaling.}
Increasing batch size from 128 to 512 (row~1 vs.\ row~2) yields the largest single-factor improvement: $R^2_{med}$ from $0.9964$ to $0.9975$ and MAE$_{med}$ from 3.74 to 2.96~A/m$^2$, while halving training time (${\sim}10$~min vs.\ ${\sim}23$~min).
Using only 100k training samples (row~9) instead of the full ${\sim}120$k degrades $R^2_{med}$ from $0.9967$ to $0.9948$, confirming data scaling benefits.
Extending training to 200 epochs (row~10) provides no improvement over 100 epochs, indicating convergence within the early-stopping patience window.

\paragraph{Scalar conditioning.}
Removing upstream scalar conditioning ($V_{oc}^{pred}$, $V_{mpp}^{pred}$; row~8) barely affects median $R^2$ ($0.9966$ vs.\ $0.9967$ for Conv-NoDilation), confirming that the 31 raw parameters and 5 physics features already encode sufficient information for curve reconstruction.
The scalar inputs provide marginal benefit primarily through improved $V_{oc}$ localization.

\paragraph{Robustness across runs.}
Figure~\ref{fig:architecture_comparison} confirms tight clustering of key metrics across all 30 runs, with the non-attention conv variants all achieving median $R^2 > 0.996$ regardless of seed, demonstrating that the primary results are robust to random initialization.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{fig_architecture_comparison.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Architecture comparison across all 30 runs.} Non-attention conv variants (blue shades) cluster tightly at median $R^2 > 0.996$, while attention variants (red) and pointwise (orange) are clearly separated. The champion BS512 configuration (green) achieves the highest median $R^2$.}
    \label{fig:architecture_comparison}
\end{figure}

\emph{General finding: for short physics-governed sequences with monotonically decaying spatial correlations, bidirectional convolution with domain-matched features outperforms both attention-augmented and pointwise variants; self-attention is consistently harmful.}

\subsection{Failure Mode Analysis}
\label{sec:failure_analysis}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The left tail of the $R^2$ distribution ($R^2_{mean} = 0.986$ vs.\ $R^2_{med} = 0.998$, affecting $<$1\% of devices) arises from three physically distinct failure modes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{S-shaped / concave-up curves}: Large interface band offsets ($|\Delta E_v^{HP}|$ or $|\Delta E_c^{PE}| \gg k_BT$) produce barrier-dominated transport that violates the monotone-sigmoid assumption inherent in the PCHIP representation.
    The physics constraints \emph{correctly refuse} to fit these curves---the model produces a smooth sigmoid approximation rather than an unphysical reconstruction.
    This is failure by design: S-shaped kinks arise from interface recombination or extraction barriers that the 8-point representation cannot capture without violating monotonicity.

    \item \textbf{Mislocated knee}: When $V_{oc}$ falls far from the training-set center, the curvature maximum lies outside the dense query-point region.
    This failure mode is addressable by adaptive query-point placement conditioned on predicted $V_{oc}$---a straightforward engineering improvement.

    \item \textbf{Extreme series resistance}: $R_s^{total} > 10^3$~$\Omega\!\cdot\!\text{cm}^2$ produces nearly linear J-V curves qualitatively unlike the sigmoid majority.
    These devices have $\text{FF} \ll 0.5$ and represent impractical configurations that would never be fabricated---a measure-zero subset of the design space.
\end{enumerate}

In all three cases, the failure mode is \emph{physically interpretable} and corresponds to devices outside the intended operating regime.
A lightweight anomaly detector based on $E_g^{offset}$, $J_{max}^{log}$, and $|\Delta E_v^{HP}|$ can flag such devices at negligible computational cost before running inference.

Figures~\ref{fig:best_r2} and~\ref{fig:worst_r2} contrast the best and worst reconstructions, making the failure modes visually concrete.

    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{test_plots_best_r2_samples.png}
    \caption{\textbf{Best $R^2$ reconstructions} ($\approx 1.000$): near-perfect reconstruction for well-behaved sigmoid curves with clear knee regions. These devices have favorable energetic alignment ($E_g^{offset} \approx 0$), moderate barrier heights, and high $J_{max}$, placing them squarely within the model's physics-constrained operating regime.}

These devices have large $|E_g^{offset}|$, extreme $|\chi_P^e|$ values, or $|\Delta E_v^{HP}| \gg k_BT$, violating the monotone-sigmoid assumption inherent in the PCHIP representation.}

\section{Background: Drift-Diffusion Model}
\label{sec:comsol}
%=============================================================================

The ground-truth J-V curves are generated by a coupled Poisson--drift-diffusion simulator~\cite{zhao2023phd,zhao2025ae} modeling a planar p-i-n perovskite stack: Glass / Front-contact / HTL / Perovskite absorber / ETL / Back-contact.
Optical absorption follows a vectorized transfer-matrix formulation (Appendix~\ref{app:optical}) yielding the spatially averaged photogeneration rate $G_{avg} = l_P^{-1}\int_0^{l_P} G(x)\,dx$, which enters as one of the 31 inputs.

The electronic transport is governed by three coupled PDEs:
\begin{align}
\nabla \cdot (\varepsilon \nabla \psi) &= -q(p - n + N_D^+ - N_A^-) \label{eq:poisson} \\
\frac{\partial n}{\partial t} &= \frac{1}{q} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_n - R + G \label{eq:electron} \\
\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} &= -\frac{1}{q} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_p - R + G \label{eq:hole}
\end{align}
where the current densities follow drift-diffusion:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{J}_n = qn\mu_n\mathbf{E} + qD_n\nabla n, \qquad
\mathbf{J}_p = qp\mu_p\mathbf{E} - qD_p\nabla p
\label{eq:drift_diffusion}
\end{equation}
with diffusion coefficients related to mobilities through the Einstein relation $D = \mu k_B T / q$.

Recombination combines radiative, Shockley--Read--Hall (SRH), Auger, and interface terms:
\begin{align}
R_{rad} &= B_{rad}(np - n_i^2) \label{eq:recomb_rad} \\
R_{SRH} &= \frac{np - n_i^2}{\tau_h(n{+}n_1) + \tau_e(p{+}p_1)} \label{eq:recomb_srh} \\
R_{Aug} &= (A_e n + A_h p)(np - n_i^2) \label{eq:recomb_aug}
\end{align}
with intrinsic carrier concentration $n_i = \sqrt{N_c N_v}\exp(-E_g/2k_BT)$, built-in voltage $V_{bi} = W_{anode} - W_{cathode}$, and interface recombination velocity $j_s = v_s \Delta c$.

The system is solved in COMSOL at each applied voltage $V$ to generate the $J(V)$ curve.
The 31 input parameters (Table~\ref{tab:31params}) span $>$20 orders of magnitude---from carrier mobilities (${\sim}10^{-4}$--$10^{2}$~cm$^2$/Vs) to doping densities (${\sim}10^{17}$--$10^{21}$~cm$^{-3}$) to recombination coefficients (${\sim}10^{-12}$--$10^{-6}$~cm$^3$/s)---necessitating careful preprocessing (\S\ref{sec:preprocessing}).

Three-layer ANNs with Bayesian regularization, trained on 100k LHS samples, predict scalar device metrics from the 31 raw parameters:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{31} \xrightarrow[\text{Zhao et al.}]{\text{3-layer ANN}} \{V_{oc}^{pred}, V_{mpp}^{pred}, J_{sc}^{pred}\}
\label{eq:scalar_stage}
\end{equation}
with MSE $< 3.1 \times 10^{-4}$ for $V_{oc}$, validated against 9 fabricated devices spanning $E_g \in \{1.56, 1.63\}$~eV (calibration MSE $8.2 \times 10^{-8}$--$1.8 \times 10^{-4}$)~\cite{zhao2025ae}.

\paragraph{Stage~2: Curve reconstruction (this work).}
Pre-computed scalar predictions condition the curve model alongside 31 scaled parameters and $m$ selected physics features:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}_{in} = [\,\underbrace{\mathbf{x}^{sc}}_{31}\;;\;\underbrace{V_{oc}^{pred},\, V_{mpp}^{pred}}_{\text{Stage 1}}\;;\;\underbrace{\boldsymbol{\phi}(\mathbf{x})}_{m}\,]
\xrightarrow{f_\theta} \hat{\mathbf{J}} \in \mathbb{R}^{8}
\label{eq:curve_stage}
\end{equation}
where $m = 5$ after train-only feature selection (\S\ref{sec:feature_selection}).

The two-stage design provides three critical properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{No inter-stage gradient leakage}: the curve model consumes scalar predictions as fixed inputs, preventing error backpropagation from distorting scalar predictors.
    \item \textbf{Swappability}: ground-truth scalars can replace predicted scalars during debugging and ablation, isolating curve-model errors from upstream prediction errors.
    \item \textbf{Independent execution}: Stage~1 runs in ${\sim}0.3$~s for 100k samples; both stages execute independently with different training procedures and hyperparameters.
\end{enumerate}

    The modular architecture enables independent training, validation, and deployment of each stage. Scalars are pre-computed and stored as external files, enabling transparent swapping between ground-truth and predicted values for ablation studies.}

\paragraph{ML surrogates for perovskites.}
Prior machine learning surrogates for perovskite solar cells predict scalar properties: band gap from composition~\cite{feng2024bandgap}, formability classification~\cite{talapatra2021formability}, lattice constants~\cite{zhang2020lattice}, and device-level metrics (PCE, FF)~\cite{hu2022ml,oboh2024nn}.
None predict full J-V curves from material parameters.

\paragraph{J-V curve prediction.}
Two concurrent works address J-V reconstruction for perovskite devices (Table~\ref{tab:comparison}).
Toprak~\cite{toprak2025jv} mapped irradiance and voltage $(G, V)$ to current density $J$ for a \emph{single fixed device geometry} (2 input dimensions, $R^2 = 0.994$, 8k training samples).
Zbinden et al.~\cite{zbinden2026ae} used conditional variational autoencoders for forward and inverse J-V modeling from 6 fabrication parameters ($R^2 = 0.996$, 50k training samples, validated on 4 fabricated devices).
Our work generalizes across 31 coupled drift-diffusion dimensions with ${\sim}150$k training samples and explicit physics constraints, and contributes the architectural finding that bidirectional convolutions outperform attention-based and pointwise architectures on short physics-governed sequences.

\paragraph{Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).}
Classical PINNs embed PDE residuals as loss terms, requiring PDE evaluation during training.
Our approach instead uses physics to \emph{inform inputs} (71 derived features) and \emph{constrain outputs} (monotonicity, convexity, curvature), avoiding PDE evaluation entirely.
This is closer to the ``physics-informed feature engineering'' paradigm than to residual-based PINNs.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}
%=============================================================================

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

Given device parameters $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{31}$ and upstream scalar predictions $\{V_{oc}^{pred}, V_{mpp}^{pred}\}$, predict a compact J-V representation:
\begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{J}} = f_\theta(\mathbf{x}_{in}; \mathbf{V}_{query}) \in \mathbb{R}^8
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{V}_{query}$ are 8 voltage query points concentrated near the MPP.
Convention: positive photocurrent ($J > 0$ for $V < V_{oc}$).
The full 45-point J-V curve is recovered via PCHIP interpolation from the 8 predicted points.

\subsection{Data}
\label{sec:data}

Two LHS campaigns generate the ground-truth dataset:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Campaign 1}: 100k samples $\to$ usable subset after COMSOL convergence filtering
    \item \textbf{Campaign 2}: 300k samples $\to$ usable subset after filtering
    \item \textbf{Combined}: ${\sim}$150k devices after convergence and quality filtering, split 80/10/10 train/val/test (120k/15k/15k)
\end{itemize}

Filtering removes only devices where COMSOL failed to converge or produced grossly unphysical curves (e.g., negative $J_{sc}$, $V_{oc} < 0$); no curvature-based or performance-based filtering is applied, preserving the full LHS distribution including pathological devices.

The voltage grid is \textbf{non-uniform} (Figure~\ref{fig:voltage_grid}), with resolution concentrated where device-performance sensitivity is highest:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Low voltage} ($0 \leq V \leq 0.4$~V): 5 coarse points, $\Delta V = 0.1$~V
    \item \textbf{Knee/MPP region} ($0.425 \leq V \leq 1.4$~V): 40 dense points, $\Delta V = 0.025$~V
    \item \textbf{Total}: $N_V = 45$ points
\end{itemize}

This design reflects the physics: the flat-band region ($V \ll V_{mpp}$) has $J \approx J_{sc}$ with near-zero curvature, while the knee region contains the MPP, the drift-to-recombination transition, and the approach to $V_{oc}$---all critical for fill-factor evaluation and device optimization.
The non-uniform spacing necessitates $\Delta V$-weighted evaluation metrics (\S\ref{sec:metrics}).

\begin{figure}[t]

    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{\input{figures/voltage_grid_design.tex}}
    \caption{\textbf{Non-uniform voltage grid and $\Delta V$-weighted loss.}

    (b)~$\Delta V$-weighted curve loss with Gaussian emphasis $w_j$ centered at $V_{mpp}$ ($w_{mpp} = 2$, $\sigma_w = 0.1$~V), preventing low-information flat-band points from dominating the objective while concentrating fitting effort where power extraction and device-performance sensitivity are highest.}
    \label{fig:voltage_grid}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Dataset statistics.}
Figure~\ref{fig:dataset_stats} summarizes the ${\sim}150$k-device dataset.
The LHS design achieves near-orthogonal parameter coverage (most pairwise correlations $< 0.2$), ensuring that the training data uniformly spans the design space.
Figure~\ref{fig:current_density_boxplots} shows the per-voltage-point $J$ distributions: spread is minimal at low $V$ (flat-band: $J \approx J_{sc}$) and peaks near the knee/$V_{mpp}$, directly motivating the dense grid and curvature-based sample weighting.

\end{figure}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Preprocessing}
\label{sec:preprocessing}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\paragraph{Parameter scaling.}
The $>$20 orders-of-magnitude dynamic range requires multi-stage normalization.
Parameters are grouped by physical type, with group-specific transformations:
\begin{equation}
x \!\xrightarrow{\log_{1p}}\! x' \!\xrightarrow{\text{Robust}}\! \frac{x' - \tilde{x}'}{\text{IQR}} \!\xrightarrow{\text{MinMax}}\! x''' \!\in\! [-1, 1]
\label{eq:scaling}
\end{equation}

The four groups are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Thicknesses} (3): $l_H, l_P, l_E$ $\to$ RobustScaler $\to$ MinMax$[-1,1]$
    \item \textbf{Material properties} (19): mobilities, DOS, energies, permittivities $\to$ $\log_{1p}$ $\to$ RobustScaler $\to$ MinMax$[-1,1]$
    \item \textbf{Contacts} (2): $W_{anode}, W_{cathode}$ $\to$ RobustScaler $\to$ MinMax$[-1,1]$
    \item \textbf{Recombination/generation} (7): $G_{avg}$, Auger, $B_{rad}$, lifetimes, surface velocities $\to$ RobustScaler $\to$ MinMax$[-1,1]$
\end{itemize}

RobustScaler uses median and interquartile range (IQR) rather than mean and standard deviation, providing resilience to outliers from the LHS tails.
The $\log_{1p}$ transform compresses the multi-order-of-magnitude range of material properties before robust scaling.
All transformer parameters are fit exclusively on the training split and stored via \texttt{joblib} for reproducible deployment.
Figure~\ref{fig:boxplot_normalized} confirms that the multi-stage pipeline compresses the $>$20 orders-of-magnitude dynamic range into a well-behaved $[-1,1]$ interval with outliers contained within $[-3, 3]$.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{normalized_all.png}
  \caption{\textbf{All 31 parameters after normalization} ($\log_{1p}$ $\to$ RobustScaler $\to$ MinMax$[-1,1]$). Outliers are visible but contained within $[-3, 3]$, confirming that the multi-stage normalization handles the $>$20 orders-of-magnitude dynamic range effectively.}
  \label{fig:boxplot_normalized}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Compact curve representation.}
Rather than predicting all 45 grid points directly, each J-V curve is represented by \textbf{8 query points} concentrated near the MPP.
The full 45-point curve is recovered by PCHIP interpolation~\cite{fritsch1980monotone} with Fritsch--Carlson slopes, which preserves monotonicity by construction---simultaneously achieving dimensionality reduction ($45 \to 8$) and encoding a physics prior (monotone decreasing $J(V)$).

Figure~\ref{fig:interp_fidelity_pair} quantifies this approximation.
The 8-point PCHIP reconstruction achieves $R^2 = 0.994$ against the full COMSOL reference; by ${\sim}10$ points the representation error saturates at ${\sim}0.999$.
The 8-point budget is Pareto-optimal: sufficient fidelity for practical applications while keeping the sequence short enough for efficient convolutional processing.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{jv_curve_8_point_reconstruction_example.png}
  \hfill
  \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{reconstruction_number_vs_number_of_points.png}
  \caption{\textbf{PCHIP reconstruction fidelity.}
  \textbf{Left}: 8-point reconstruction (dashed orange) vs.\ COMSOL reference (solid blue), $R^2 = 0.994$.
  The representation faithfully captures both the flat photocurrent plateau and the sharp knee transition.
  \textbf{Right}: $R^2$ vs.\ number of query points; performance saturates at ${\sim}0.999$ by 10 points and ${\sim}0.9997$ by 12 points. The 8-point budget is Pareto-optimal, balancing fidelity against model output dimensionality and sequence length for the convolutional backbone.}
  \label{fig:interp_fidelity_pair}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Current normalization.}
Curves are $J_{sc}$-normalized to decouple magnitude from shape, enabling the network to learn shape independently of overall current scale:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{J}(V) = 2\,J(V)/J_{sc} - 1 \in [-1, 1]
\label{eq:normalization}
\end{equation}
so that $\tilde{J}(0) = +1$ and $\tilde{J}(V_{oc}) = -1$.
Denormalization recovers absolute current: $J(V) = (\tilde{J}(V) + 1) \cdot J_{sc} / 2$.

Training samples are additionally weighted by curvature:
\begin{equation}
w_i = 1 + 4.0\,(\kappa_i / \kappa_{max})^{1.5}
\label{eq:sample_weight}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa_i$ is the maximum curvature of sample $i$.
This emphasizes sharp-knee devices that are most informative for fill-factor prediction and most challenging to reconstruct.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Physics Feature Engineering}
\label{sec:physics_features}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the raw 31 parameters, we derive 71 features encoding closed-form approximations of the drift-diffusion equations---the \emph{same physics} that COMSOL solves numerically, expressed analytically (Table~\ref{tab:physics_features}; full definitions in Appendix~\ref{app:features}).
These features are computed once during preprocessing and cached as part of the input tensor.

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Physics feature taxonomy (71 total). Each category derives from a specific aspect of the drift-diffusion equations. Features encode the same physics COMSOL solves numerically, providing the network with physically meaningful coordinates that shortcut nonlinear representation learning.}
\label{tab:physics_features}
\begin{tabular}{@{}llcl@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Physical origin} & $n$ & \textbf{Key features} \\
\midrule

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Physically notable features include the \textbf{Hecht extraction figures of merit}~\cite{courtier2019transport}, which quantify the competition between charge extraction (drift) and recombination:
\begin{equation}
\Theta_e = \frac{\mu_n^P \tau_e V_{bi}}{l_P^2}, \qquad
\Theta_h = \frac{\mu_p^P \tau_h V_{bi}}{l_P^2}, \qquad
\Theta_{min} = \min(\Theta_e, \Theta_h)
\label{eq:theta}
\end{equation}

$\Theta \gg 1$ indicates extraction-dominated transport (high fill factor, efficient charge collection); $\Theta \ll 1$ signals recombination-limited operation (low fill factor, S-shaped risk).
Although $\Theta_{min}$ is an important physical concept, it does not survive train-only feature selection (\S\ref{sec:feature_selection}) because its predictive information is already encoded by the combination of upstream features ($E_g^{offset}$, $J_{max}^{log}$) that capture the same $V_{bi}$, $l_P$, and transport physics through less redundant coordinates.

\textbf{Composite predictors} combine multiple physical mechanisms into quantities that approximate device-level metrics:
\begin{align}
\text{FF}_{pred} &= \log\Theta_{min} - \log R_s^{total} \label{eq:ff_pred} \\
V_{oc}^{pred} &= E_g + \tfrac{1}{2}(\Phi_{h,ETL} + \Phi_{e,HTL}) - k_BT\log R_{SRH} \label{eq:voc_pred} \\
J_{sc}^{pred} &= \log(J_{max}) + \log(\eta_{coll,min}) \label{eq:jsc_pred} \\
\text{Quality} &= \log(\Theta_{min}) + \text{SRH}_{str} - \log(R_s^{total}) \label{eq:quality}
\end{align}
These provide the network with physically meaningful coordinates, shortcutting the nonlinear combinations (products, ratios, exponentials of 6 or more raw parameters) that it would otherwise need to discover.

\textbf{Analytical ceiling functions} bound scalar predictions:
\begin{align}
J_{sc}^{ceil} &= qG_{avg}l_P \qquad \text{(Beer--Lambert absorption limit)} \label{eq:jsc_ceil} \\
V_{oc}^{ceil} &= \min(E_g, V_{bi}) \qquad \text{(thermodynamic + electrostatic bound)} \label{eq:voc_ceil} \\
V_{mpp}^{est} &= V_{oc} - k_BT\ln(1 + V_{oc}/k_BT) \qquad \text{(Shockley approximation)} \label{eq:vmpp_est} \\
\text{FF}^{est} &= \frac{v_{oc} - \ln(v_{oc} + 0.72)}{v_{oc} + 1}, \quad v_{oc} = V_{oc}/(k_BT) \qquad \text{(Green formula)} \label{eq:ff_green}
\end{align}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Physics-Guided Feature Selection}
\label{sec:feature_selection}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

While 71 candidate features encode the full analytical structure of the drift-diffusion equations, J-V curve shape is fundamentally governed by a small number of independent physical mechanisms.
We identify five governing features through a physics-first selection procedure validated by statistical analysis.

\paragraph{Physical rationale.}
The drift-diffusion equations (Eqs.~\ref{eq:poisson}--\ref{eq:drift_diffusion}) govern J-V behavior through five largely independent mechanisms:
(i)~\emph{photocurrent generation}, setting the absolute current scale;
(ii)~\emph{band gap energetics}, determining the absorption edge and thermodynamic voltage limit;
(iii)~\emph{built-in field alignment}, controlling charge extraction efficiency;
(iv)~\emph{interface band alignment}, governing carrier transfer at heterojunctions; and
(v)~\emph{non-radiative recombination}, dictating the open-circuit voltage deficit from the Shockley--Queisser limit.
Each mechanism maps to a single dominant feature:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\boldsymbol{J_{max}^{log} = \log(qG_{avg}l_P)}$---the Beer--Lambert photocurrent ceiling.
    This is the strongest single predictor of J-V curve shape ($\max|r| = 0.973$ with target current values), as it sets the absolute photocurrent scale from which all other device-level metrics derive.
    $J_{max}$ combines absorption ($G_{avg}$) and geometry ($l_P$), capturing the dominant source of inter-device variability in the current axis.

    \item $\boldsymbol{E_g}$---the perovskite band gap ($\max|r| = 0.432$).
    $E_g$ directly determines the absorption edge and the thermodynamic upper bound for $V_{oc}$ via the Shockley--Queisser limit.
    Changes in $E_g$ shift the entire J-V curve along the voltage axis and modulate $J_{sc}$ through the solar spectrum overlap.

    \item $\boldsymbol{E_g^{offset} = E_g - V_{bi}}$---the mismatch between band gap and built-in potential ($\max|r| = 0.324$).
    When $E_g^{offset} > 0$, the internal electric field ($V_{bi}/l_P$) is insufficient to sweep carriers across the full energy range, causing voltage-dependent extraction losses that reshape the knee region and degrade fill factor.
    This feature encodes the competition between the thermodynamic voltage window ($E_g$) and the electrostatic driving force ($V_{bi} = W_{anode} - W_{cathode}$).

    \item $\boldsymbol{\chi_P^e}$---the perovskite electron affinity ($\max|r| = 0.334$).
    $\chi_P^e$ determines the conduction band offset at the perovskite/ETL interface ($\Delta E_c^{PE} = \chi_{ETL}^e - \chi_P^e$), governing whether electrons face an extraction barrier.
    Large $|\Delta E_c^{PE}|$ produces S-shaped kinks in the J-V curve; moderate alignment enables efficient electron collection.

    \item $\boldsymbol{V_{oc}^{loss} = -E_g/(k_BT) + \log(R_{SRH})}$---a composite recombination metric ($\max|r| = 0.432$).
    This feature encodes the competition between the thermodynamic $V_{oc}$ limit (set by $E_g$) and non-radiative SRH recombination losses, directly predicting the voltage at which the J-V curve crosses zero.
    The logarithmic form linearizes the exponential dependence of $J_0$ on recombination rates.
\end{enumerate}

Together, these five features span the primary determinants of J-V shape: photocurrent magnitude ($J_{max}$), voltage limits ($E_g$, $V_{oc}^{loss}$), fill factor ($E_g^{offset}$), and carrier extraction ($\chi_P^e$).

\paragraph{Statistical validation.}
A two-stage statistical filter confirms the physics-based selection:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Multicollinearity analysis}: among all 71 candidate features, 175 pairs exhibit Pearson $|r| > 0.85$, revealing extensive redundancy.
    For example, the three generation-related features ($J_{max}^{log}$, $G_{per\,nm}^{log}$, $G_{avg}^{log}$) are mutually correlated ($|r| > 0.9$) because they differ only by factors of $q$ and $l_P$; similarly, all Hecht extraction figures of merit ($\Theta_e$, $\Theta_h$, $\Theta_{min}$) and diffusion length ratios ($\eta_{coll,e}$, $\eta_{coll,h}$) are collinear with $l_P$-dependent features ($|r| > 0.93$).
    Dropping the less informative member of each correlated pair eliminates 34 features (71$\to$37).

    \item \textbf{Relevance filter}: of the remaining 37 features, only those with $\max_{y \in \text{targets}} |r(\phi_i, y)| \geq 0.3$ are retained, removing 32 features with negligible independent predictive power---including all series resistance features ($R_s^{HTL}$, $R_s^{ETL}$, $R_s^{total}$; $|r| < 0.001$), all permittivity-related and thickness-ratio features, and all Auger and radiative recombination terms ($|r| = 0.0$).
\end{enumerate}

The two filters independently converge on $m = 5$ features (71$\to$37$\to$5), matching the five physical mechanisms identified above.
Importantly, the multicollinearity analysis \emph{confirms} the physical intuition: the 66 eliminated features encode overlapping aspects of the same underlying transport physics.
The drift-diffusion equations impose strong inter-feature correlations (e.g., $\Theta_{min}$ is algebraically related to $L_n$, $\mu\tau$, and $\eta_{coll}$ through shared dependence on $\mu$, $\tau$, $V_{bi}$, and $l_P$), making most intermediate quantities redundant once the five governing mechanisms are directly represented.

\paragraph{Why not $\Theta_{min}$ or $R_s^{total}$?}
Although the Hecht extraction parameter $\Theta_{min}$ and total series resistance $R_s^{total}$ are physically important concepts~\cite{courtier2019transport}, they do not survive the selection procedure.
$\Theta_{min}$ achieves only $\max|r| = 0.189$ with target variables---below the relevance threshold---because its predictive information is already captured by the combination of $E_g^{offset}$ (which encodes the $V_{bi}/l_P^2$ dependence) and $J_{max}^{log}$ (which encodes $l_P$ and generation effects).
$R_s^{total}$ achieves $|r| < 0.001$, reflecting the fact that in the LHS parameter space, most devices have sufficiently low series resistance that $R_s$ does not limit J-V shape; resistive effects only dominate in the extreme tail of the distribution (\S\ref{sec:failure_analysis}).

\paragraph{Interpretation: low-dimensional physics.}
The compression from 71 to 5 reveals that the physics feature space is highly structured.
This is consistent with the generalized Shockley diode equation:
\begin{equation}
J(V) = J_{sc} - J_0\!\left[\exp\!\left(\frac{qV}{nk_BT}\right) - 1\right] - \frac{V}{R_{sh}}
\label{eq:shockley}
\end{equation}
which relates J-V shape to just 3--4 effective parameters ($J_{sc}$, $J_0$, $n$, $R_s$).
Our five selected features provide physically interpretable coordinates for this low-dimensional manifold: $J_{max}^{log}$ maps to $J_{sc}$; $E_g$ and $V_{oc}^{loss}$ together determine $J_0$ and $n$; $E_g^{offset}$ and $\chi_P^e$ modulate the ideality factor and parasitic losses.

The feature mask is computed exclusively on the training split and stored alongside the model checkpoint; no target information from validation or test data influences feature selection.
A hash of the training indices is stored for reproducibility verification.

\subsection{Architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The full forward pass maps device parameters to 8 current-density predictions:
\begin{align}
&\underbrace{\mathbf{x}_{in} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_{in}}}_{31+2+m}
\xrightarrow{\text{ParamMLP}}
\mathbf{h} \in \mathbb{R}^{128} \nonumber \\
&\xrightarrow[\text{concat}]{\oplus\,\text{RBF}(\mathbf{V})}
\mathbf{S} \in \mathbb{R}^{8 \times 256}
\xrightarrow{\text{DilConv}\times 3}
\xrightarrow{\text{Lin}}
\hat{\mathbf{J}} \in \mathbb{R}^{8}
\label{eq:arch}
\end{align}

\paragraph{ParamMLP.}
A three-layer MLP embeds the concatenated input ($\mathbf{x}^{sc}$, scalars, selected features) into a fixed-size representation:
$d_{in} \to 256 \to 128 \to 128$, with GELU activation, BatchNorm, and Dropout($p{=}0.036$) after each layer.
The output $\mathbf{h} \in \mathbb{R}^{128}$ is a device-level embedding shared across all voltage query points.

\paragraph{Gaussian RBF positional encoding.}
Each voltage query point $V_j$ is encoded via learnable Gaussian radial basis functions:
\begin{equation}
\text{RBF}(V_j) = \bigl[\exp\!\bigl(-(V_j - \mu_k)^2 / 2\sigma_k^2\bigr)\bigr]_{k=1}^{128}
\label{eq:rbf}
\end{equation}
where centers $\mu_k$ are initialized uniformly over $[0, V_{max}]$ and bandwidths $\sigma_k$ are learnable.
The 128-dimensional device embedding $\mathbf{h}$ is broadcast across 8 voltage positions and concatenated with the 128-dim RBF encoding, producing $\mathbf{S} \in \mathbb{R}^{8 \times 256}$---a sequence representation where each position encodes both device properties and voltage location.

\paragraph{Dilated 1D conv backbone.}
Three residual blocks with symmetric (non-causal) padding process the sequence:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccl@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{Block} & \textbf{Channels} & $k$ & $d$ & \textbf{Details} \\
\midrule
1 & $256 \to 128$ & 5 & 1 & Conv-BN-GELU-Drop(0.036) + skip \\
2 & $128 \to 128$ & 5 & 1 & Residual connection \\
3 & $128 \to 64$ & 5 & 2 & RF $> 8$: full bidirectional coverage \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent Output: pointwise Linear($64 \to 1$) $\to$ $\hat{\mathbf{J}} \in \mathbb{R}^8$.

\paragraph{Why dilation suffices.}
Block~3's dilation $d{=}2$ with kernel $k{=}5$ gives a single-layer receptive field of 9 positions ($= k + (k-1)(d-1)$), already exceeding the 8-point sequence length.
Combined with Blocks~1--2, every output position has \emph{bidirectional} context over all 8 input positions.
This is the architectural mechanism that makes self-attention unnecessary (\S\ref{sec:ablation}): global context is already provided by the convolutional architecture, and the local inductive bias of convolution better matches the monotonically decaying spatial correlation structure of J-V curves.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Physics-Constrained Loss}
\label{sec:loss}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The total loss combines reconstruction accuracy with four physics-motivated penalties:
\begin{multline}
\mathcal{L} = \underbrace{0.98 \cdot \mathcal{L}_{MSE}}_{\text{reconstruction}}
+ \underbrace{0.005 \cdot \mathcal{L}_{mono}}_{\text{monotonicity: }dJ/dV \leq 0}
+ \underbrace{0.005 \cdot \mathcal{L}_{conv}}_{\text{convexity: }d^2J/dV^2 \leq 0} \\
+ \underbrace{0.01 \cdot \mathcal{L}_{curv}}_{\text{curvature bound}}
+ \underbrace{\lambda_{jac} \cdot \mathcal{L}_{jac}}_{\text{Jacobian smoothness}}
\label{eq:loss}
\end{multline}

Each penalty encodes a qualitative property of physical J-V curves:

\paragraph{Reconstruction loss.}
Weighted mean squared error on the 8 predicted current values:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{MSE} = \frac{1}{8B} \sum_{i=1}^{B}\sum_{j=1}^{8} w_{ij}(\hat{J}_{ij} - J_{ij})^2
\label{eq:mse}
\end{equation}
where $w_{ij}$ incorporates sample curvature weighting (Eq.~\ref{eq:sample_weight}).

\paragraph{Monotonicity penalty.}
Current density must decrease with voltage in the power-producing quadrant ($dJ/dV \leq 0$):
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{mono} = \frac{1}{7B} \sum_{i,j} [\text{ReLU}(\hat{J}_{i,j+1} - \hat{J}_{i,j})]^2
\label{eq:mono}
\end{equation}
Penalizes any predicted increase in current with voltage---a direct encoding of the fundamental physics that net photocurrent decreases as the applied voltage reduces the built-in field and enhances recombination.

\paragraph{Convexity penalty.}
In the knee region, J-V curves are concave (negative second derivative):
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{conv} = \frac{1}{6B} \sum_{i,j} [\text{ReLU}(2\hat{J}_{i,j} - \hat{J}_{i,j-1} - \hat{J}_{i,j+1})]^2
\label{eq:convex}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Excess curvature penalty.}
Bounds the magnitude of the second finite difference to prevent oscillatory artifacts:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{curv} = \frac{1}{6B} \sum_{i,j} [\text{ReLU}(|\Delta^2 \hat{J}_{ij}| - 0.8)]^2
\label{eq:curv}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Jacobian regularization.}
A smoothness prior on the parameter-to-curve mapping:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{jac} = \frac{1}{d_{in}} \left\|\frac{\partial \hat{\mathbf{J}}}{\partial \mathbf{x}_{in}}\right\|_F^2
\label{eq:jacobian}
\end{equation}
estimated via Hutchinson's trace estimator with $K{=}4$ random projections in fp32 (bf16 causes overflow due to the squared norm computation).
Default $\lambda_{jac} = 0$; recommended range $[10^{-4}, 10^{-2}]$ when Jacobian smoothness is desired for inverse design (\S\ref{sec:inverse}).

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{$\Delta V$-Weighted Evaluation Metrics}
\label{sec:metrics}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The non-uniform voltage grid necessitates $\Delta V$-weighted metrics to ensure that evaluation reflects physical significance rather than grid density.
Without weighting, the 40 dense knee-region points ($\Delta V = 0.025$~V) would dominate the 5 coarse flat-band points ($\Delta V = 0.1$~V), making errors in the flat-band region invisible.

The $\Delta V$-weighted per-curve $R^2$:
\begin{equation}
R^2_i = 1 - \frac{\sum_j \Delta V_j \bigl(\hat{J}_i(V_j) - J_i(V_j)\bigr)^2}{\sum_j \Delta V_j \bigl(J_i(V_j) - \bar{J}_i\bigr)^2}
\label{eq:dv_r2}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{J}_i = \sum_j \Delta V_j J_i(V_j) / \sum_j \Delta V_j$ and $\Delta V_j = V_{j+1} - V_j$ (last point repeated).

The $\Delta V$-weighted curve loss used during training:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{curve} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N_V} \Delta V_j \, w_j \, (\hat{J}_j - J_j)^2}{\sum_{j=1}^{N_V} \Delta V_j \, w_j}
\label{eq:dv_loss}
\end{equation}
with Gaussian MPP emphasis ($w_{mpp} = 2$, $\sigma_w = 0.1$~V):
\begin{equation}
w_j = 1 + (w_{mpp} - 1)\exp\!\left(-\frac{(V_j - V_{mpp})^2}{2\sigma_w^2}\right)
\label{eq:gaussian_weight}
\end{equation}

We report mean, median, 5th percentile, and 95th percentile $R^2_i$ aggregates across the test set.

\section{Analysis and Discussion}
\label{sec:analysis}
%=============================================================================

\paragraph{Architectural inductive biases.}
The ablation results (\S\ref{sec:ablation}) are explained by the physics of J-V curves.
J-V responses describe thermodynamic equilibria, not temporal sequences: at any voltage, the current depends on the full band diagram ($V_{bi} - V$ across the entire device), recombination landscape, and carrier extraction at both contacts.
This explains why bidirectional context outperforms causal masking.
Similarly, J-V spatial correlations decay monotonically with voltage separation---$J(V_j)$ and $J(V_k)$ are most correlated for small $|j-k|$ and progressively decorrelate at larger separations---matching convolution's local inductive bias.
Attention treats all voltage pairs uniformly, amplifying noise from weakly coupled points where the dilated receptive field already provides sufficient context.

\paragraph{Physics features as PDE summaries.}
Without the derived features, the MLP must discover nonlinear combinations such as:
\begin{align*}
J_{max} &= q G_{avg} l_P & \text{(3 raw params)} \\
V_{oc}^{loss} &= -E_g/(k_BT) + \log(R_{SRH}) & \text{(4+ raw params)} \\
E_g^{offset} &= (E_g^h - E_g^e) - (W_{anode} - W_{cathode}) & \text{(4 raw params)}
\end{align*}
spanning 6 orders of magnitude.
With the derived features, the MLP learns only the residual mapping from pre-computed physics to J-V shape.
The most impactful feature is $J_{max}^{log}$ (photocurrent ceiling, $|r| = 0.973$), followed by $G_{avg}^{log}$ (generation rate, $|r| = 0.582$), $E_g$ (band gap, $|r| = 0.432$), and $V_{oc}^{loss}$ (recombination loss, $|r| = 0.432$).

\paragraph{Feature selection reveals low-dimensional structure.}
The compression from 71 candidate features to $m = 5$ informative features implies that the relevant physics of J-V shape can be summarized by five independent physical mechanisms (\S\ref{sec:feature_selection}).
$J_{max}^{log}$ emerges as the single strongest predictor ($|r| = 0.973$), consistent with its role as the Beer--Lambert absorption limit that sets the absolute current scale of the J-V curve.
The remaining four features ($E_g$, $E_g^{offset}$, $\chi_P^e$, $V_{oc}^{loss}$) each capture a distinct aspect of voltage-axis physics and carrier extraction.
The elimination of 66 features without performance loss implies that diffusion lengths ($L_n$, $L_p$), $\mu\tau$ products, Hecht parameters ($\Theta_e$, $\Theta_h$), barrier heights, and series resistance all encode overlapping aspects of the same transport physics---the drift-diffusion equations impose strong inter-feature correlations (175 pairs with $|r| > 0.85$).

Notably, the five surviving features are all ``upstream'' quantities---fundamental material properties and their direct combinations---rather than ``downstream'' derived transport metrics ($\Theta_{min}$, $L_n$, $R_s^{total}$).
This suggests that the network benefits most from physically interpretable coordinates that are minimally redundant, rather than from pre-computed transport summaries that, while conceptually useful, share extensive mutual information through their common dependence on the raw parameters.

\paragraph{Scalar-to-curve error propagation.}
The two-stage pipeline's modular design raises a natural question: how sensitive is curve quality to upstream scalar errors?
The ablation removing scalar conditioning entirely (Table~\ref{tab:ablation_results}, row~8) shows that curve $R^2_{med}$ changes from $0.9975$ to $0.9966$---a marginal difference confirming that the curve model is robust to the small upstream prediction errors ($V_{oc}$ MSE $< 3.1 \times 10^{-4}$~\cite{zhao2025ae}).
The dominant source of reconstruction error is intrinsic to the curve model, not propagated from Stage~1.

\paragraph{Comparison with related approaches.}
Our model's median $R^2 = 0.998$ exceeds both Toprak ($R^2 = 0.994$ on a 2-input single-device problem)~\cite{toprak2025jv} and Zbinden et al.\ ($R^2 = 0.996$ on a 6-parameter problem)~\cite{zbinden2026ae}, while operating in a 31-dimensional parameter space with explicit physics constraints.
The upstream scalar predictors have been experimentally validated against 9 fabricated perovskite devices spanning $E_g \in \{1.56, 1.63\}$~eV~\cite{zhao2025ae}, with calibration MSE ranging from $8.2 \times 10^{-8}$ to $1.8 \times 10^{-4}$.
Zbinden et al.~\cite{zbinden2026ae} provide complementary validation on 4 devices, supporting drift-diffusion--trained surrogates as viable for real-world deployment.

%=============================================================================
\section{Applications}
\label{sec:applications}
%=============================================================================

\paragraph{High-throughput screening.}
A $10^6$-device Latin Hypercube sweep---${\sim}160$ years via COMSOL at ${\sim}4800$~s/device---completes in $<$1~hour with the surrogate.
Full-curve evaluation captures fill-factor degradation mechanisms and S-shaped kinks that scalar-only screening~\cite{hu2022ml} misses entirely, enabling discovery of devices with high nominal PCE but poor operational stability signatures.
The curve representation also enables voltage-dependent analysis: identifying which devices maintain current at high voltages (desirable for tandem applications) vs.\ which exhibit premature roll-off.

\paragraph{Inverse design via Jacobian.}
\label{sec:inverse}
The differentiable surrogate provides analytic Jacobian $\partial \hat{\mathbf{J}}/\partial \mathbf{x}$, enabling gradient-based optimization toward target J-V properties (Figure~\ref{fig:inverse_design}):
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}^{(t+1)} = \mathbf{x}^{(t)} - \eta\,\nabla_{\!\mathbf{x}}\mathcal{L}_{target}, \qquad
\nabla_{\!\mathbf{x}}\mathcal{L}_{target} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_{target}}{\partial \hat{\mathbf{J}}} \cdot \frac{\partial \hat{\mathbf{J}}}{\partial \mathbf{x}}
\label{eq:inverse}
\end{equation}

Unlike scalar optimization (``maximize PCE''), curve-level inverse design can target specific J-V shape properties: maximum fill factor, smooth knee curvature, or matching a reference profile from a champion device.
Combined with Zhao et al.'s 24~s experimental calibration protocol~\cite{zhao2025ae}, this enables a closed-loop \emph{characterize $\to$ predict $\to$ optimize} workflow within a single experimental session.

    \label{fig:inverse_design}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Sensitivity analysis.}
The Jacobian $\partial \hat{\mathbf{J}}/\partial \mathbf{x}$ also enables systematic sensitivity analysis: which parameters most strongly influence each region of the J-V curve.
This produces physics-interpretable results---e.g., mobilities and lifetimes dominate the knee region, while contact work functions primarily affect $V_{oc}$---that can guide experimental efforts toward the parameters with highest leverage for improving specific aspects of device performance.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
%=============================================================================

We presented a physics-constrained dilated convolutional network for J-V curve reconstruction in perovskite solar cells, achieving median $R^2 = 0.9975$ across ${\sim}15$k test devices spanning 31 coupled drift-diffusion parameters with $>$20 orders of magnitude in dynamic range.
The model reconstructs $V_{oc}$ to 0.39~mV median error (below experimental measurement uncertainty) and median MAE of 2.96~A/m$^2$ ($<$0.5\% of typical $J_{sc}$), completing training in ${\sim}10$~min and enabling $>$$10^4\times$ speedup over COMSOL FEM.

Three physics priors contribute complementarily:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Input enrichment}: 71 analytically derived features encode drift-diffusion physics; train-only selection reveals that only 5 carry non-redundant information, each mapping to an independent physical mechanism: photocurrent generation ($J_{max}$), band gap energetics ($E_g$), built-in field alignment ($E_g^{offset}$), interface band alignment ($\chi_P^e$), and recombination losses ($V_{oc}^{loss}$).
    \item \textbf{Output constraints}: monotonicity, convexity, and curvature penalties enforce qualitative properties guaranteed by the underlying PDEs.
    \item \textbf{Jacobian smoothness}: regularization of the parameter-to-curve map for well-posedness and inverse design.
\end{enumerate}

The systematic ablation (10 configurations $\times$ 3 seeds) yields a general architectural finding: \emph{for short physics-governed sequences with monotonically decaying spatial correlations, bidirectional convolution with domain-matched features outperforms both attention-augmented and pointwise variants.}
Self-attention consistently degrades performance because it introduces spurious pairwise interactions where convolution's local inductive bias better matches the physics.

The modular two-stage pipeline, with independently trained scalar predictors~\cite{zhao2025ae} conditioning the curve model, enables transparent validation and swappable components.
The differentiable surrogate provides analytic Jacobians for gradient-based inverse design targeting specific J-V shape properties.

Future directions include:
deep-ensemble uncertainty quantification for deployment safety,
Bayesian optimization for closed-loop experimental design,
extension to tandem perovskite/silicon architectures~\cite{zhao2023phd},
end-to-end joint training of both pipeline stages,
and out-of-distribution detection to flag devices outside the training manifold.

\section{Optical Model Details}
\label{app:optical}

Light propagation follows the vectorized transfer-matrix formulation~\cite{zhao2023phd}.
The electric field in layer $n$:
\begin{equation}
E_z(x) = A_n e^{-ik_n(x-L_{n-1})} + B_n e^{ik_n(x-L_{n-1})}
\end{equation}
where $k_n = k_0(n_n - i\kappa_n)$.
Photogeneration rate in the absorber:
\begin{align}
G(x) &= \frac{1}{hc} \int_{\lambda_l}^{\lambda_u} \lambda \, Q(x,\lambda) \, d\lambda \\
Q &= \frac{1}{2} c \varepsilon_0 \alpha n \, |E_z|^2, \quad \alpha = \frac{4\pi\kappa}{\lambda}
\end{align}
A phase-elimination method removes incoherent substrate interference.
$G_{avg} = l_P^{-1}\int_0^{l_P} G(x)\,dx$ enters as one of the 31 inputs.
